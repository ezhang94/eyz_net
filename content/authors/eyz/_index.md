I am PhD student in Stanford's Electrical Engineering department and advised by Scott Linderman. Currently, I am investigating neurological and biological function by developing methods for unsupervised behavioral modelling.

Broadly, I am interested in flexible and interpretable representations of complex systems, and the dynamics of these systems over time. I am curious about perception, learning, and knowledge structures, in both the neuroscientific context and the general life context.
